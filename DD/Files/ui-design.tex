In this section, we present user interfaces for Students and Educators. We created a detailed user interface design to inform the reader from a broader perspective.  It provides a clear understanding of how the end-user will interact with the software. This visual representation can demonstrate the flow and layout of the application, making it easier for stakeholders to grasp the user experience. In the UI design we aim to serve as a common language for all stakeholders, including developers, designers, project managers, and clients. It helps in bridging the gap between non-technical and technical team members with help of graphical demonstration. We tried to create every screen possible in order to inform to developers and stakeholders as much as possible. Developer can simplify and advance this user interface designs if they needed.

Naturally runtime views contain much information however user design shows the application from students and educators. However, every mockup is somehow related to a runtime view. Related runtime views are shown.
